🧠 My Contribution

- Reimplemented the Chromafactor NMF-based deconvolution pipeline in Python
- Performed data preprocessing and matrix construction for chromatin signal representation
- Applied Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to extract latent chromatin organization components
- Analyzed biological interpretability of learned factors

Documented the full computational workflow for reproducibility
